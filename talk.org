#+TITLE: A beamer talk

* Introduction
** First Slide

This slide is the introduction

- Who I am: Tamara Temple
- Where to find me:
  - twitter: @tamouse
  - github: @tamouse
  - email: tamara@tamouse.org

** Second Slide

What this talk is about

- just some rambling
- who is asking?

* What about Beamer

** Need to have it in your emacs init

In your emacs ~.init.el~ somewhere, add:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-beamer)
#+END_SRC

And you should have all the goodness available

** Exporting to PDF

Use the standard org-mode LaTeX publishing to a PDF:

- ~C-c C-e l O~ - publishes the presentation to a PDF file and opens it in the PDF viewer (Preview on macOS)
- that's an "ell" lower case
- then "OH" upper case

** The Beamer Header

YASnippet has a default snippet included: ~beamer~ that inserts the appropriate header, except for one thing:

- it includes the line ~#+BEAMER_FRAME_LEVEL: 2~ which is incorrect. Instead use options:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+OPTIONS: H:2 toc:t
#+END_SRC

- sets the "slide" marker to heading level 2, and includes a table of contents of the level 1 headings.

** More header goodness

I added to following to make a nicer presentation:

- TITLE
- AUTHOR
- EMAIL
- DATE
- DESCRIPTION
- KEYWORDS

** Multi-Column Slides

Beamer and org-mode give support for 2-up (side-by-side) slides, too

- make sure you load up ~org-beamer-mode~
- create the sub-sub-section (one below the slide heading level)
- ~C-c C-b |~ (pipe symbol) to define a column

** Two Column Slide

*** Left-hand Side                                                    :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:

- some stuff
- and more stuff

and then...

*** Right-hand Side                                                   :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:

... the other thing happened!
